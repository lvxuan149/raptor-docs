# What Is Raptor

## Raptor Story

We are building a massive purple Raptor culture rooted in the Soon community, a cyber velociraptor paradise, where we build purple dinosaur homes in the Soon ecosystem.

Raptor is The Fiercest LiquidityInfrastructure on Soon SVM, designed to provide users with a seamless and efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) experience. By leveraging advanced technology and innovative features, Raptor aims to redefine how users interact with liquidity pools and trading.

## Raptor Feature：

- **Highest Annual Percentage Yields (APY) in DEX**: Raptor offers some of the most competitive APYs, attracting liquidity providers seeking high returns.
- **Active and Passive Market Making:** Users can engage in both active market making—profiting from strategic orders based on price fluctuations—and passive market making—providing liquidity without constant monitoring, thus enabling more flexible trading strategies.
- **Singleton-Pool Design:** Raptor employs a singleton contract to manage all pools. This design significantly reduces gas costs associated with pool creation and multi-pool trading. The introduction of state compression allows for the storage of large amounts of data, while the singleton structure ensures efficient routing across all available pools.
- **Enhanced Protocol Performance:** Raptor is optimized for swap operations, accelerating transaction speeds which are crucial for traders who rely on timely execution to seize market opportunities.
